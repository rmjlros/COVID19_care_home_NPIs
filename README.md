  This study simulates SARS-CoV-2 transmission in an English care home and evaluates the probability of an outbreak over time for a care home with non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) already in place. The model includes resident hospitalisation, testing of residents and staff, isolation of residents, absence and replacement of staff, and resident death. 
  
  The authors evaluate the relative importance of the different routes of importation to the care home: from hospital through the hospitalisation of residents, from the community through visitors, and from the community through staff. They also address the impact of impact of additional control measures, namely: increasing staff and resident testing frequency, using lateral flow antigen testing (LFD) tests instead of PCR, enhancing infection prevention and control (IPC), increasing the proportion of residents isolated, shortening the delay to isolation, improving the effectiveness of isolation, restricting visitors and limiting staff to working in one care home.

  A description of each file and folder is provided below:
  
  **00_load_packages_data.R:** `R` script to load and process data needed to run DLNMs in INLA models. There is no need to run this script. It is sourced by the following scripts. 

**01_visual_data.R:** `R` script to explore and visualise dengue, hydrometeorological and socio-economic datasets.

**02_model_models.R:** `R` script to run DLNM-INLA models of increasing complexity.

**03_model_output.R:** `R` script to explore and visualise model outputs from the selected model.

**04_lag_nonlinear_output.R:** `R` script to explore and visualise exposure-lag-response associations given different socio-economic scenarios.

**05_sensitivity_analysis.R:** `R` script to test sensitivity of exposure-lag-response associations.

**data:** a folder containing the database, data description, and a grid file for `facet_geo()` plots (in .csv format), and shapefiles (.shp, .shx, .dbf, .prj). 

**figs:** a folder to save the figures generated by the `R` scripts.

**output:** a folder to save the model outputs. This also contains a subfolder named **preds**, with the R script used to generate the cross-validation exercise and associated output files. 

**COVID19_care_home_NPIs.Rproj:** An `RStudio` project file, to avoid having to set your working directory to the hydromet_dengue folder on your computer.
